# Tiles

---

### Known bugs

- When clicking the same tile twice, the tile clears itself. This ruins the prospect of completing the game in one unbroken streak.

### Unimplemented features

- There is nothing to indicate which tile is currently selected.
- There is no game over screen or anything to indicate that you have completed the game.

## How to use

First, the Main class is the entry point of the entire program. Next, to use this program, the user is required to find
tiles that have at least one or more matching elements. Correctly matching these tiles causes the matching elements to
disappear. The game is over when all the tiles have been cleared.
